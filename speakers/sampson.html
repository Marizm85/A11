                What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage
                Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan armed with your best dinosaur
                roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of
                Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused
                on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has
                conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.

                Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his
                Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work
                focused on two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from
                the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function
                of ceratopsid horns and frills.

                Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the
                American Museum of Natural History in New York City, followed by
                five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College
                of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University
                of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the
                Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate
                paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
                interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional
                morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.

                In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has
                conducted paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and
                Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also the
                on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently
                completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of
                Life, which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs
                and their worlds to date.
